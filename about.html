        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h2>How it all started...</h2>
        <p>
            Our friend was falsely accused of using AI to do his work.
            He was forced to redo his assignment or get a zero. This was his reaction:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/falseAccusation.JPG" alt="Reaction image">
        <p>
            He had no way to prove his innocence. We saw how this negatively impacted his mental health and reputation.
            We wanted a way to protect students against false accusations but also give teachers confidence that
            students are not using AI to complete their assignments.
            The idea for Aidify was born.
        </p>
        <h2>Creation of Aidify...</h2>
        <p>
            In the summer of 2023, we developed our idea further through the DMZ Basecamp program. Through the help and
            encouragement of our mentors, we were one of the winners of the DMZ pitch competition.</p>
        <p>
            We built Aidify from scratch on our own. We wanted something simple that did not require any student
            software installation. After many iterations, we created Aidify as a Chrome extension to measure student
            effort by analyzing the work that goes into a Google Document.
        </p>
        <h2>Our mission...</h2>
        <p>
            We want to share Aidify with as many students and teachers as possible. We truly believe this tool is
            necessary
            in a world where AI is becoming increasingly relevant.
            Aidify allows students to defend their work and gives teachers assurance that AI is being used responsibly.

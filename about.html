      <h1>Our Solution</h1>
      <h2>1. Geoanalysis and Bioprospecting</h2>
      <p>
        Before establishing the microalgae cultivation system, it is essential
        to perform a thorough geoanalysis and bioprospecting process to identify
        the optimal location and select the most suitable microalgae strains.
        The geoanalysis involves surveying potential sites near coastal regions
        to assess factors such as climate, available land, access to seawater,
        and proximity to infrastructure. The goal is to find a location that can
        naturally support rapid algae growth with minimal energy inputs. Hot,
        dry desert environments near upwelling ocean currents are often ideal,
        as they provide the necessary sunlight, temperature, and nutrient-rich
        seawater. Concurrently, the bioprospecting team filters through
        thousands of local microalgae strains to identify the ones that best fit
        the use case. Selected species need to be well-adapted to the local
        climate, can thrive in the available seawater conditions, and have
        desirable properties for other applications. By using native algae
        species, the risk of introducing invasive organisms is minimized.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Growing Algae — Lab to Greenhouse</h2>
      <p>
        After selecting the location and constructing necessary infrastructure,
        the first step is to grow an algal starter monoculture in a controlled
        laboratory environment. This is where the key initial conditions are
        carefully managed to kick-start the rapid "bloom" phase of algae growth.
        In the lab, factors like temperature, light exposure, nutrient levels,
        and CO2 concentration are precisely regulated to optimize the growth of
        a specific microalgae species. This allows the algae to enter an
        explosive yet sustainable growth phase with the population doubling
        daily, enabling the algae culture to be scaled up in the next step.
        Furthermore, to ensure a smooth transition for the algae, they will
        first be transferred to a greenhouse. The greenhouse will provide more
        natural environmental conditions, while still offering some additional
        protection and control compared to outdoor ponds. By doing this, the
        organisms will gradually adapt to the environment in the outside ponds.
        This helps maximize the overall biomass yield and productivity of the
        process.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Algae Growth In Ponds</h2>
      <p>
        After the initial growth in the lab and greenhouse, the microalgae is
        transferred to large outdoor ponds. These ponds contain seawater, rich
        with nutrients and CO2 for the algae to grow, that is pumped directly
        from nearby coastlines, providing a natural environment for the algae.
        Combined with the large surface area, exposure to sunlight, CO2, and
        nutrients, the algae will grow at an exponential rate. As a positive
        side-effect, the cultivation of microalgae in these open ponds will help
        enhance the alkalinity of the ocean water, which is an effective
        strategy for addressing ocean acidification. As the microalgae
        photosynthesize and remove CO2 from the seawater, they increase the pH
        and thus the alkalinity of the water. The removal of CO2 reduces the
        concentration of carbonic acid and increases the concentration of
        bicarbonate and carbonate ions. This increased alkalinity helps to
        neutralize the excess acidity in the oceans caused by the absorption of
        anthropogenic CO2 emissions from the atmosphere. Over time, it will help
        mitigate the detrimental effects of ocean acidification on marine
        ecosystems. In order to monitor the pond conditions such as pH levels,
        temperature, and nutrient levels needed for algal blooms are consistent,
        sensors are deployed. This is crucial to maintaining the maximum growing
        rate for algae.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Filtration And Drying</h2>
      <p>
        When the ponds reach a desired level of algae concentration, motor-powered filtration systems will separate all the algal biomass from the water using specialized membranes, creating a thick "slurry" of the harvested algae. After the algae is removed, the filtered water is returned to the ocean. The water is now de-acidified, which helps restore the local marine ecosystem's biodiversity and contribute towards solving ocean acidification.
        In the meantime, harvested algae will be pumped up a drying tower – approximately 10 stories high – and sprayed down from the top as a mist. As the algae float downwards through the tower, it will come in contact with the hot, dry air. The heat and low humidity of the air cause rapid evaporation of the water in the biomass slurry. Finally, when they reach the ground, the biomass will take the form of a dry, salty powder, making them easy to store and transport.
        This dry-spraying process is highly efficient and effective at the same time. Locating the drying tower in a hot, dry desert climate minimizes the energy required for drying by harnessing the natural environmental conditions. Furthermore, spray drying can preserve the nutritional and functional properties of the microalgae biomass.
